axios , react-router-dom @ramonak/react-progress-bar
 ### Features

## Bugs
Showing evolution list is buggy
### Code through
firstly i fetched data from api
then stored all data in context , and used data from context 
For filteration I used old data 
For evolution it was challenging , but I can not understand where evolution list is stored for example it is showing me all evolution list for kid pokemon but second level pokemon evolution data it is taking another pokemon data , but in the future mastering of using api after I wiil solve this problem  
Speaking briefly I used react hooks,@ramonak/react-progress-bar for progress bar axios library for fetching data, react-router-dom for linking to evolution list , for designing I choosed to write by scratch by myself , I thought for internship it is not good idea , to  use external libraries for designing like bootstarp,material ui
